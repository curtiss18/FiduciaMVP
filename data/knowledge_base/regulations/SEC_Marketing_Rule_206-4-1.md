## Executive Summary

The SEC Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1) represents the most significant overhaul of investment adviser marketing regulations in over 60 years. Adopted on December 22, 2020, this rule replaces and modernizes the previous advertising rule (206(4)-1) and cash solicitation rule (206(4)-3) into a single, comprehensive framework. The rule uses principles-based prohibitions rather than prescriptive requirements to address modern marketing practices, technology advances, and evolving investor expectations.

## Key Definitions

### Advertisement
The rule defines "advertisement" in two parts:
1. **Direct/Indirect Communications**: Any communication that offers investment advisory services to prospective clients or new services to current clients (excludes one-on-one communications)
2. **Compensated Testimonials/Endorsements**: Any testimonial or endorsement for which the adviser provides direct or indirect compensation

### Covered Entities
- SEC-registered investment advisers
- Investment advisers required to be registered with the SEC under Section 203 of the Advisers Act
- Communications with private fund investors (Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) funds)

## Seven General Prohibitions

The Marketing Rule establishes seven core prohibitions that apply to ALL advertisements:

### 1. Material Misstatements or Omissions
- **Prohibition**: No untrue statements of material fact or omissions that make statements misleading
- **Standard**: Evaluated based on total mix of information and target audience

### 2. Unsubstantiated Claims
- **Prohibition**: No material statements without reasonable basis for belief that they can be substantiated upon SEC demand
- **Requirement**: Must maintain supporting documentation

### 3. Untrue or Misleading Implications About SEC
- **Prohibition**: Cannot imply SEC approval, sponsorship, or endorsement of the adviser
- **Application**: Includes references to registration status that could mislead

### 4. References to Specific Past Recommendations
- **Prohibition**: Cannot reference specific profitable recommendations unless presentation is fair and balanced
- **Requirements**: Must provide context and not cherry-pick favorable results

### 5. References to Charts, Formulas, or Devices
- **Prohibition**: Cannot reference investment analysis tools without explaining their limitations and difficulties
- **Application**: Includes model portfolios, backtesting, and algorithmic strategies

### 6. Free Services Claims
- **Prohibition**: Cannot claim services are "free" unless truly provided without cost or condition
- **Standard**: No hidden fees, minimum account requirements, or other conditions

### 7. Self-Referential or Circular Claims
- **Prohibition**: Cannot include statements that are materially misleading about the adviser or its services
- **Standard**: Broad anti-fraud provision covering any misleading content

## Testimonials and Endorsements

The rule allows testimonials and endorsements (previously prohibited) if certain conditions are met:

### Required Disclosures
1. **Client/Non-Client Status**: Clear identification of whether testimonial is from current client
2. **Compensation Disclosure**: Whether cash or non-cash compensation was provided
3. **Material Conflicts**: Any conflicts of interest related to the testimonial

Cannot compensate "bad actors" or ineligible persons as defined under Rule 506(d) of Regulation D.
