# SCRUM-42 Testing Strategy & Implementation Status

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ WORKING: Backend Multiple File Upload (Phase 1 Complete)
- Multiple file upload API: `/api/v1/advisor/documents/upload-file` ✅
- Batch processing with AI summarization ✅  
- Document storage with session association ✅
- Test results: 100% success rate with 3 files ✅

### ❌ MISSING: Frontend File Upload Integration
**Issue**: ChatInterface shows TODO instead of actual upload functionality
**Location**: `frontend-advisor/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx:494`
**Status**: File upload components exist but not connected to backend API

### ❌ MISSING: Warren Document Context Integration  
**Issue**: Warren V3 doesn't retrieve session documents for context
**Location**: `src/api/endpoints.py` Warren V3 endpoint
**Impact**: Uploaded documents not used in content generation

## Testing Strategy

### Option 1: Test Backend Only (Current Capability)
You can test the complete backend flow right now:

```bash
# Test multiple file upload (already working)
python test_multiple_upload.py

# Test Warren V3 without documents (already working)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/warren/generate-v3" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "request": "Create a LinkedIn post about retirement planning",
    "session_id": "session_test-advisor-scrum42_a655cda0"
  }'
```

### Option 2: Complete Integration (15 minutes)
To test the full workflow, we need:

1. **Warren Document Integration** (10 min):
   - Add session document retrieval to Warren V3
   - Integrate document summaries into context assembly
   
2. **Frontend Upload Connection** (5 min):
   - Connect AttachmentDropdown to documentApi
   - Replace TODO with actual upload functionality

### Option 3: Manual Testing Workflow (5 minutes)
Test the intended workflow manually:

1. Upload documents via API (working ✅)
2. Check documents are stored with session (working ✅)  
3. Manually verify Warren could use documents (need integration ❌)
4. Test frontend upload UI (need connection ❌)

## Recommendation

**For MVP Testing**: Focus on Option 1 - test what's working
**For Complete Feature**: Implement Option 2 - add missing integrations

The backend foundation is solid (100% success rate), but the Warren context integration is the key missing piece for the full user experience.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test current backend capabilities
2. **Short-term**: Add session document retrieval to Warren V3  
3. **Complete**: Connect frontend upload to backend API

Would you like me to:
A) Test the current backend functionality more thoroughly?
B) Implement the Warren document context integration?
C) Connect the frontend upload to the backend?
